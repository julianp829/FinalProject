        <p>SyncPlay RPS is a cooperative, team-based twist on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. Players join a team and face off against other teams in real-time rounds where they work together to make strategic choices. As they win rounds, they contribute to the teamâ€™s score and build a winning streak. The game provides a fun, interactive experience that blends real-time collaboration with competitive gameplay.</p>
